# Implementation Steps

## Progress Overview

- [x] 1. Bootstrap Next.js foundation (App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest + Testing Library)
- [x] 2. Build authentication shell & layout (Basic auth middleware, dev script, AppShell, view toggle)
- [x] 3. Implement image upload flow (form, validation, Workers API `/images` POST, R2 storage, D1 metadata, UI feedback)
- [x] 4. Deliver management views (Workers API `/images` GET, table/gallery views, search, sort, pagination, URL copy/download)
- [x] 5. Maintenance actions (multi-select deletion, ZIP archive download API/UI)
- [x] 6. Cloudflare API polish (structured error responses, logging hooks, ZIP safeguards & docs)
- [x] 7. Operations & monitoring (logging/monitoring hooks, secrets management, wrangler/pages deployment docs)
- [ ] 8. Acceptance & documentation (end-to-end testing, known issues, final user guide)

## Notes

- Cloudflare resources currently provisioned: R2 bucket `imgdose`, D1 database `imgdose`.
- Wrangler v4 scripts (`npm run cf:*`) execute via Node.js 20 shim located in `temp/`.
- Worker secrets already contain R2 access credentials and account ID.
- Apply D1 migrations with `npm run cf:d1:migrate` before deploying.

## Deployment

- **Workers**: Manual deployment via `npm run cf:deploy` (see `docs/deployment.md`)
- **Pages**: Automatic deployment on push to `main` via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
- **Secrets**: Managed via Wrangler CLI and Cloudflare dashboard (see `docs/secrets-management.md`)
